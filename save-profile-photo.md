# How to Add Your Profile Photo

I've successfully updated your neotodak.com website with a new About section that includes a place for your profile photo!

## Steps to Complete:

1. **Save your profile photo:**
   - Save the photo you shared as `neo-profile.jpg`
   - Place it in: `/Users/broneotodak/Projects/neotodak-ai-labs/images/neo-profile.jpg`

2. **Test locally:**
   - Open the `index.html` file in your browser to preview
   - Your photo should appear in the About section with a nice AI-themed border and glow effect

3. **Deploy to Netlify:**
   ```bash
   cd /Users/broneotodak/Projects/neotodak-ai-labs
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add founder profile photo and About section"
   git push origin main
   ```

## What I've Added:

âœ… **New About Section** with:
- Professional profile photo display with AI-themed styling
- Animated background effects
- Your name and title
- Brief description of your mission
- Key highlights (Founded 10+ AI Projects, AI & ML Solutions, Democratize AI)
- Social links (GitHub, LinkedIn, Email)

âœ… **Responsive Design:**
- Looks great on desktop with side-by-side layout
- Adapts to mobile with stacked layout
- Smooth animations and hover effects

âœ… **AI-Themed Styling:**
- Neon blue border around photo
- Pulsing background effect
- Gradient text for your name
- Consistent with the rest of your site's futuristic theme

The About section is positioned between Projects and Features sections, and the navigation menu already links to it properly!

## Optional Customizations:

- Update the social media links with your actual profiles
- Modify the description text if needed
- Add more highlight items
- Change the badge text or colors

Your site is looking professional and impressive! ðŸš€
